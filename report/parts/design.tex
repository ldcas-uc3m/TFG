\chapter{Design}\label{chap:design}
This chapter provides a full description of the proposed solution. It details the system's design process, by discussing the different alternatives (\secref{study}), and describes the proposed architecture (\secref{architecture}), including all components and design decisions.


\section{Study of the Solution}\label{sec:study}  % STATE OF THE ART II
After the elicitation of the requirements (\secref{requirements}) and use cases (\secref{use-cases}) of the system, the tools to build the application must be discussed, as the design will depend on them.


\subsection{Instruction Definition Language}\label{subsec:inst-lang-study}
\reqref[Requirement]{SR-FC-05} calls for the creation of a language to encode the functionality of the different \glspl{instruction} on the \gls{ISA}. This language is the one that the simulator will actually execute. This language, as per \reqref[requirement]{SR-NF-09}, should be simple and easy to understand.

One approach is to use a generic assembly language, such as the one described in the IEEE Standard for Microprocessor Assembly Language \parencite{IEEE-694-1985}. This is a set of common set of \glspl{instruction} for all microprocessors, and \textit{should} cover all \gls{ISA} possibilities. The main problem with this solution is that it wouldn't solve the main problem, to teach the user \gls{assembly} programming, as the \glspl{instruction} would be encoded in yet another \gls{assembly}. Therefore, some other type of simple and generic language that's easier to understand must be used.

There are scripting languages with good integration with other programming languages, such as Lua \parencite{lua}. Being an embeddable language, it can function as a simple language to interact with an application. Lua is currently used in several projects, such as Neovim \parencite{nvim-lua} and Lua\TeX~\parencite{luatex}. The problem with this approach is \reqref[requirement]{SR-NF-08}; Lua is not easily validatable due to the complexity of the language. 

The final approach is to create a domain-specific language. This language should be simple, but able to execute any computation, and abstract enough to be easy to understand. The solution is to implement a language in the LISP family, a concept similar to WebAssembly's Text Format \parencite{wasmtext}. LISP \parencite{mccarthy1960recursive} is a simple recursive language whose operations are based on symbolic expressions. Expressions are lists of elements, where the first element is the operator and the rest of elements the operand. Elements can be atomic (numbers, operators, etc.), or other lists, which will be synthesized into atomic elements by the recursive pattern. By implementing in the language the basic operations described in \reqref[requirement]{SR-FC-02}, all of the goals for a simple language that supports any possible \gls{ISA} are fulfilled.


\subsection{Interpreter}\label{subsec:interpreter-study}
\reqref[Requirement]{SR-FC-06} states that the system must be able to execute the \gls{instruction} definition language, and \reqref[requirement]{SR-FC-07} states it should be able to do it \gls{instruction} by instruction. Therefore, the best approach is to create an \gls{interpreter} for the LISP-like language.

To implement an \gls{interpreter} for any language, there are two main steps involved: processing the input into an \gls{AST} (\textit{parsing}), and executing it with the help of the \gls{AST} (\textit{evaluating}) \parencite{mogensen2009basics}.

Nowadays, there are tools that, given a language definition as an input, generate parsers for those languages, simplifying the process of creating an \gls{interpreter}. Such is the case of Lex and yacc \parencite{LevineJohnR1992Ly} (or its modern counterpart, Flex and bison \parencite{LevineJohnR2009Fb}), and ANTLR \parencite{ParrTerenceTerenceJohn2010Lip}. These parser generator tools generate libraries that parse the inputs into \glspl{AST} that can be later used in the evaluation phase. The main problem with this approach is that you need to re-generate the parser libraries each time you modify the language, which gives less flexibility to add new features (floating point operations, etc.).

The final approach is to build the \gls{interpreter} from scratch. Being a LISP-like language comes with the advantage of simplifying the \gls{interpreter}'s design. Make-A-Lisp \parencite{mal} is a guide for implementing a generic LISP \gls{interpreter}, and outlines the basic functionalities and architecture.


\subsection{ISA Definition Format}\label{subsec:isa-format-study}
\reqref[Requirement]{SR-NF-07} specifies that the format used to define and store the \gls{ISA} must be simple and easy to modify. The best approach is to use a text-based format, as they are human-readable and can be modified by any basic text editor, without the need for any specific tools. Furthermore, it allows us to encode with text  both the defined \glspl{assembly} and \gls{instruction} definition language, simplifying the system's implementation.

The best approach is to use a structured data format. There are many formats, but the most widely used are those who store data in attribute-value pairs and arrays, as is the case of the \gls{json} \parencite{ISO21778} and the \gls{yaml} \parencite{yamlspec} formats. While both formats offer libraries for parsing and validating files in many programming languages, the \gls{json} format is a `friendlier' format for \gls{HTTP} due to the fact that it ignores whitespace, unlike \gls{yaml}. Using \gls{json} over \gls{yaml} offers many possibilities for the use of the system in other environments, such as \glspl{web service}.


\subsection{Programming Language}\label{subsec:language-study}
As per \reqref[requirements]{SR-NF-01}, the \gls{programming language} must allow the system to be executed natively and on multiple platforms. Native execution has the advantage of producing more performant code, as there is no overhead derived from virtual machines or \glspl{interpreter}. Popular natively compiled languages include C \parencite{KernighanBrianW1988TCpl}, C++ \parencite{StroustrupBjarne2013TCpl}, Rust \parencite{KlabnikSteve2023TRpl}, and Go \parencite{DonovanAlan2015TGPL} \parencite{statista2023langstats}.

Furthermore, \reqref[requirement]{SR-NF-02} states that the system shall also support multiple platforms, and this includes browsers. Through the use of WebAssembly \parencite{HaasAndreas2017Btwu}, many programming languages can be compiled and executed `natively' in the browser, including all previously mentioned languages.

From the mentioned languages, C++ (specifically the current standard at the time of writing, ISO C++20 \parencite{ISOcpp20}) was chosen for several reasons:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It's a mature language, with support for modern features and multiple \glspl{programming paradigm}.
  \item It's strongly typed, memory safe, and high-performant, with zero-cost abstractions.
  \item It's an ISO standard language.
\end{itemize}



\section{System Architecture}\label{sec:architecture}
The system's architecture can be divided in four main elements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Compiler:} Translates the \glsdisp{assembly}{assembly-like} programs into the \gls{interpreter}'s language, using the \gls{instruction} definitions.
  \item \textbf{Memory:} Stores the \glspl{instruction} and program memory.
  \item \textbf{\gls{CPU}:} Fetches, decodes, and executes the \glspl{instruction} (in the interpreter's language), and stores the \glspl{register}.
  \item \textbf{\gls{CLI}:} Provides the \gls{UI} and coordinates all the other elements.
\end{itemize}

\figref{component_diagram} details the UML component diagram \parencite{Cook2017} of the system, including all of its components. \tabref{comp-template} provides the template used for the specification of the components, including the description of each attribute. The successive tables describe each of the components.

\subsection{Instruction Definition Language}\label{subsec:inst-lang-design}
As stated in Subsection \ref{subsec:inst-lang-study}, the language used to define the instructions is a language from the LISP family. The developed language is LUISP-DA (\textit{assembLy analogoUs lISP DiAlect}).

Being a LISP-like language, instructions are defined as LISP expressions, comprised of lists of symbols and/or other lists, delimited by parenthesis. Inner expressions are evaluated first, recursively. To simplify the language, there are no variables, macros, or functions, as they are not necessary for defining basic instructions.

\noindent
There are three data types:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \qdist{NUM}, integer numbers.
  \item \qdist{BOOL}, boolean values.
  \item \qdist{NIL}, `none' type.
\end{itemize}

The first element of each expression is called the \textit{operator}, and takes the rest of the elements of the expression the values the operator is applied to. There are several predefined operators, which can be categorized by type they evaluate to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Operators that evaluate to \qdist{NUM}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{add}: Adds two values.
    \item \textit{sub}: Subtracts two values.
    \item \textit{neg}: Negates a value.
    \item \textit{mul}: Multiplies two values.
    \item \textit{div}: Divides two values.
    \item \textit{mod}: Module of two values.
    \item \textit{get-reg}: Gets the contents of a \gls{register}.
    \item \textit{set-reg}: Stores a value in a \gls{register}. Evaluates to the value.
    \item \textit{get-pc}: Gets the current \gls{program counter}.
    \item \textit{set-pc}: Stores a value in the \gls{program counter}. Evaluates to the value.
    \item \textit{get-mem}: Gets the value in a memory address.
    \item \textit{set-mem}: Stores a value in a memory address. Evaluates to the value.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Operators that evaluate to \qdist{BOOL}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{lt}: Evaluates if a value is less than other value.
    \item \textit{le}: Evaluates if a value is less or equal than other value.
    \item \textit{gt}: Evaluates if a value is greater than other value.
    \item \textit{ge}: Evaluates if a value is greater or equal than other value.
    \item \textit{eq}: Evaluates if a value is equal to other value.
    \item \textit{ne}: Evaluates if a value is not equal to other value.
    \item \textit{not}: Negates a value.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
There are other `special' operators, as well:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Blocks (\qdist{block}) allow the user to evaluate an infinite number of expressions, one after the other, the whole expression evaluating to \qdist{NIL}.
 \item Conditionals (\qdist{conditional}) enable \glsdisp{branch}{branching}, by using an \textit{if-then-else} structure. If the first element evaluates to \texttt{true}, the the conditional evaluates to the second element; and if the condition evaluates to \texttt{false} (or \qdist{NIL}), it evaluates to the third element instead (if the third element doesn't exist, it evaluates to \qdist{NIL}).
 \item \Glspl{system call} (\qdist{call}) evaluates the first element, known as the \textit{opcode}, and executes the specified \textit{call} with its arguments. The \textit{opcodes} are defined in the \gls{ISA}. There defined \textit{calls} are:
 \begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textit{print-int}: Prints a value as an integer to \gls{STDOUT}.
    \item \textit{read-int}: Stores a value from \gls{STDIN} in a \gls{register}.
    \item \textit{print-char}: Prints a value as an ASCII character to \gls{STDOUT}.
    \item \textit{read-char}: Stores an ASCII character from \gls{STDIN} in a \gls{register}.
    \item \textit{exit}: Ends the execution of the program.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Control Unit}\label{subsec:interpreter-design}
The LUISP-DA \gls{interpreter} is implemented in the \reqref{Control Unit} component. As stated in Subsection \ref{subsec:interpreter-study}, the architecture of the \gls{interpreter} will be based on the Make-A-Lisp \parencite{mal} architecture. Nevertheless, as it is only needed to model a simple \glsdisp{assembly}{assembly-like language}, a subset of the original architecture will be used, modified in order to fit the project's purposes.

\figref{interpreter_architecture} shows an overview of the Control Unit. As stated in Subsection \ref{subsec:interpreter-study}, the interpretation is done in two stages:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{\nameref{subsubsec:read}:} The instruction, a string, is parsed into an \gls{AST}.
  \item \textbf{\nameref{subsubsec:eval}:} The \gls{AST} is evaluated recursively.
\end{enumerate}

Finally, after each instruction (except the ones inside a \qdist{block}), the \gls{program counter} is incremented.

\graphicfigure[.8]{interpreter_architecture}{Control Unit architecture}

\subsubsection{READ}\label{subsubsec:read}
In this stage, the \gls{interpreter} first reads the instruction from the \reqref{Text Memory} (\textit{read-inst}), then parses the string (\textit{read-str}) and extracts (and stores) the tokens (\textit{tokenize}). After that, it starts generating the \gls{AST} by reading and evaluating the first token. This is done through the use of three functions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{read-token}: Checks if the current token is the start of an \qdist{L} token. If it is, it calls \textit{read-list} on the next token; otherwise it calls \textit{read-atom} on the current token. It returns the generated \gls{AST}.
  \item \textit{read-list}: Creates a new \gls{AST} node, and iteratively calls \textit{read-token} on all the following tokens until it reaches an \qdist{R} token, adding the resulting nodes as children of the current node. Finally, it returns the new node.
  \item \textit{read-atom}: Evaluates the current token's type (by searching the token in the ENV), and returns a new \gls{AST} node.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{EVAL}\label{subsubsec:eval}
After \textit{read-inst} returns the \gls{AST} of the instruction, it is evaluated through the use of two functions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{eval-token}: Reads the node's token. If it's an \qdist{R} token, it calls \textit{eval-ast} on all the arguments (all children nodes except the first one), executes on the \reqref{ALU} the operator (first child) with the results as arguments, and returns the result. If it has no children, it returns a \qdist{NIL} node, and if it has only one child, it returns the child node. In any other case, it calls \textit{eval-ast} on the node.
  \item \textit{eval-ast}: Reads the node's token. If it's an \qdist{R} token, it creates a new node with an \qdist{R} token, adds as children of that node the result of calling \textit{eval-token} on all the original node's children, and returns the new node. Otherwise, it returns the current node.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The first symbol of the \gls{AST} is passed to \textit{eval-token} to start the evaluation.


\subsection{Program Files}
\reqref[Requirement]{SR-FC-08} states that the system must be able to load \glsdisp{assembly}{assembly-like} programs.

\glsdisp{assembly}{Assembly} programs allow the user to load both \gls{text memory} and \gls{data memory} before the execution, by dividing the program in two segments: a data segment and a text segment. For the simulator, the user will be allowed to load data in the form of strings or \glspl{word}\footnote{For more information, see \subsecref{isa-design}.}. The simulator will also support the use of tags, references to instruction addresses, in order to simplify the \glsdisp{branch}{branching} syntax. Finally, there will be support for comments.

\noindent
For more information about the use of the program files, see \appref{manual}.


\subsection{Compiler}\label{subsec:compiler-design}
According to \reqref[requirement]{SR-FC-06}, the system must be able to transform \glsdisp{assembly}{assembly-like} instructions into interpreter instructions.

The compiler will go through the program file, line by line (ignoring empty lines), searching for the data and text segment keywords, and applying different procedures for each segment:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\glsdisp{data memory}{Data} segment:} The compiler will read the tag, type and value of each datum to store, map the tags to the memory references, and store the data in \gls{data memory}.
  \item \textbf{\glsdisp{text memory}{Text} segment:} The compiler will go instruction by instruction, translating them to LUISP-DA instructions, and temporarily with the locations of tags, if any. Afterwards, the compiler will translate the tags in the instructions by the addresses they represent, and load the finished instructions in the \gls{text memory}.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{ISA Definition}\label{subsec:isa-design}
As stated in Subsection \ref{subsec:isa-format-study}, the \gls{ISA} will be defined in a \gls{json} format, which will also serve as the configuration file for the simulator. For the configuration, several things need to be defined:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The name of the architecture.
  \item The start addresses of \gls{data memory} and \gls{text memory}, as well as the end address of the \gls{data memory}.
  \item The \glspl{register}.
  \item The \glspl{system call}' \textit{opcodes}.
  \item The instruction set, mapping the \glsdisp{assembly}{assembly-like} instruction syntax, the instruction code and the arguments, into the LUISP-DA language.
  \item The keywords for the different data types.
  \item The comment character.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
For more information about the use of the \gls{ISA} definition files, see \appref{manual}.
