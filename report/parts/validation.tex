\chapter{Verification and Validation}\label{chap:validation}
The main objective of this chapter is to verify that all the requirements, specified in \chapref{analysis}, have been fulfilled.

In software engineering, verification and validation are the processes of checking that a software system meets its specifications and fulfills its intended purpose \parencite{IEEE1012-2012}. \figref{verif_process} summarizes the process of software validation and verification.

\drawiosvgfigure[.8]{verif_process}{Software verification and validation process overview}

As stated in \chapref{analysis}, the customer initially sets the requirements desired for the final product, the user requirements. From there, analysts derive and specify the software requirements. In order to verify that the project requirements are met, verification and validation processes are needed.

Software verification (\secref{verification}) is the process of evaluating work-products (not the actual final product) of a development phase to determine whether they meet the specified requirements for that phase (the software requirements). Software validation (\secref{validation}) is the process of evaluating the final product at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies the requirements specified by the user at the beginning of the project \parencite{IEEE1012-2012}.

For both verification and validation, several tests were designed in order to evaluate the corresponding requirements. Each test is uniquely identified by an ID. The ID follows the format \textit{YYY-XX}, where \textit{XX} identifies the sequential number of the test case, starting at \textit{01}, and \textit{YYY} represents the type, either \textit{VET} (verification) or \textit{VAT} (validation). \tabref{test-template} provides the template used for the specification of the test case, including the description of each attribute.

\section{Verification Tests}\label{sec:verification}
In order to perform the verification tests, a dynamic process during the development phase of the software was followed. With these tests the aim is to answer the question ``\textit{Are we building the product correctly?}''.

\tabref{traceability-sr-vet} shows the traceability between the software requirements and the verification tests.
