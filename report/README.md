# TFG Report

## Pre-requisites

First you must install [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

- For Linux, install `texlive-full`.
- For Windows, install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download#win), make sure you add it to your `PATH`, and install [Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). If itâ€™s not installed already, open the MikTeX Package Manager and install the `latexmk` package.
- For MacOS, install [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) and then install `latexmk` with:
    ```
    sudo tlmgr install latexmk
    ```


As we'll use SVG files, you'll need to install [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). If you're in Windows, make sure to add the executable to your PATH (typically located in `C:\Program Files\Inkscape\bin\`).
